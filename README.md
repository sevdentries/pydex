CS11 Final project; a simple file explorer built purely in python and tkinter. 
It is meant to be an extension of the features tested in one of my previous projects (directory scanning using os.walk).
There are three main goals driving this project:
- Usability/Functionality: Be somewhat useful
- Simplicity: Minimize installscripts, use modules built-in to python
- Accessibility: Maintain most of the features someone would want from a file explorer (read, edit, rename, delete, copy, etc)
Also has cross-platform support, mostly due to its simplicity. (No mac because I don't have one to test on unfortunately)
Thank you for viewing this project, and thanks to Mr. Robideau for the assignment.
